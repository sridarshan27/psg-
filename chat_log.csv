sridarshan27,hi,"As the world's largest bitcoin exchange, Coinbase is now facing a major setback. The exchange has been forced to shut down for several weeks due to a ""technical issue.""

The company has been unable to keep up with demand and its staff has been laid off. In the meantime, the company is now offering its customers the chance to buy and sell bitcoins on its platform.

Coinbase's CEO, Andrew Liveris, said the company was ""out of control"" and that Coinbase would continue to offer its customers a chance to trade bitcoins on the platform. Liveris also noted that Coinbase has no plans to change its policy on cryptocurrency trading.
 ""The current policy is to do business with a limited number of people who are interested in bitcoins,"" he said. ""The decision to do that is a technical issue and we will continue to make changes as we go along.""
